# Hot Chocolate GraphQL Workshop Final Solution Updated

> In this repo you will find the final working version of the workshop using Hot Chocolate v13.x and .NET 7

If you are going through the official [Hot Chocolate GraphQL Workshop](https://github.com/ChilliCream/graphql-workshop), you will find out the guide is outdated when trying to use the latest Hot Chocolate version (v13) and the latest .NET with minimal APIs.

I upgraded the solution as I was working my way through the lessons. To read in more detail about all the changes, head over to my blog post below, or just dive into the code here. Just one thing, code changes as the lessons progress, so the code here might not be the same as your current lesson.
